# BART API MeAN

Writing a web application using the Javascript MeAN Stack. The application is designed to give users access to San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit train schedules. All a user has to do is put in their destination. With a destination the app will give them results for a trip to that destination from the closest BART station. The trip details will include the departure time, arrival time, and all stations in between.
